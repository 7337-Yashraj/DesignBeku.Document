## Contexts of use
	- Central driver of how work is approached
		- How things happen on a day to day basis
		- What happens with how interactions take place?
			- Between members of the collective
			- With the people that they are involved with
			- And whenever and whoever approaches them
		- Interactions between individuals, members, collaborators
## Questions of the Outsider
	- Care - what does it translate into?
		- What does care mean? In the context of producing artefacts, design objects, and socio-technical systems?
		- What role does the notion of care play, does it depend on
			- The "designer" if one were to refer to themselves as such
			- The relations between the members of the collective?
			- The collaborations that take place
			- The process that is followed whilst undertaking an engagement
		- Care: an attribute and behaviour of the human,
			- Is it a action or a manner of existence, or way of interaction, or intent that drives an individual and the collective
			- Is it spoken and takes place through deliberate conversations between the members of the collective, or organizations that approach them
				- Or is it more fluid, organic, and **care**-fully drives from the background
		- Whose definitions and understandings in what contexts, and what examples are followed?
		- Why and how is it [[Feminist]] ethical frame of care.
		- Can care be and is obtrusive? Does it act as a facilitator, or
			- Does it force and coerce?
		- How is that these papers talk about understanding the notion, and practice of care??
	- Ethical:
		- Ethics, and a conversation about ethics?
			- A question of whose ethics
				- Is it a westernized gaze towards the question of ethics
			- Are they bringing in the individual/community/people involved as a part of the conversation?
			- Is this coming on the same page/or is it a mere manner of self course correction and self
	- Frame of care?
		- Can an emotion, and behaviour based practice have a framework?
		- How does it look? Codified and mutually agreed to laws and points to be followed?
		- Or juxtaposing and co-functioning of multiple interpretations, orientations, behaviours?
		- Is it just shifting of frame of reference from heteropatriarchal policies and practices of being to a metaphor?
			- Or is it radically reaffirming, changing your point of view and day to day practices?
	- How does it function in an high-octane environment?
	- What is the point
## Interpretation and Understanding
	- Again as pointed towards by Micah, this is something that is very descriptive in nature; against the prescriptive nature
		- These things need to be felt, only through interactions, lived experiences and talking to people
## Literature Review
	- ### Quotes and what it made me feel
		-
		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  "...care for collectives tinkers with the conditions in which they live."
		  -Annemarie mol
		  #+END_QUOTE
		- What is the role of care in the collective?
			- In reference to how does it function, it is necessary to understand the term and meaning we give to the term "collective"

		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  Neither the wave not the particle
		  Neither the mob nor the loner
		  But both, and more
		  One and many,
		  Hurtling through time
		  The humans, the animals,
		  The birds in the sky, the sky,
		  The sun, the soil, the weather,
		  The phones we hold,
		  All the electricity buzzing around us
		  Through time and temporality,
		  Through histories and cycles,
		  They come together to
		  Matters of concern
		  United but divided.

		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  “it is precisely the fact that our
		  vision of the world is a vision from
		  somewhere – that it is inextricably
		  based in an embodied, and therefore
		  partial, perspective – which makes
		  us personally responsible for it.”
		  -Lucy Suchman
		  #+END_QUOTE
		-
		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  “democratic care is collaborative,
		  expressed in joint action by plural
		  participants. the practitioner of such
		  care is never a self but always an
		  association of selves. even more
		  important, the recipient of care is
		  not another person or even persons,
		  but the world, understood as the
		  array of material and immaterial
		  conditions under which human
		  beings live—both with one another
		  and with a rich variety of
		  nonhumans, organic and
		  technological."
		  -Ella Myers

		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  “rather than occupying the two
		  positions simultaneously all of the
		  time, what happens is more akin to
		  an oscillation between observation
		  and participation.”
		  -Liz Bondi
		  #+END_QUOTE
		-
		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  “the logic of care is definitely better geared to living with a diseased and unpredictable body... examine it, adapt it, fiddle with it, push and pull it, alter it, as and where this seems right. the logic of care as i articulate it here is not something to solidify or cast in stone. not at all! it is fluid and adaptable. but it is a good place to start from since, instead of addressing only the part of us that is healthy, it takes us seriously as we are, diseases and all. it seeks to nourish our bodies; respects the collectivities to which we belong; reacts forgivingly to our failures; and stubbornly strives for improvement, even if things keep on going wrong; though not beyond an (un-)certain limit, for in the end it will let go. although it is difficult to relate to one’s own suffering in a clinical way, learning to combine being active with being receptive does more than strengthening our capacity to care. for the ability to let go actively not only makes suffering easier to
		  bear.”

		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  “we can refuse to miss what we are
		  deemed to be missing. we can share a
		  refusal.”
		  -Sara Ahmed
		  #+END_QUOTE
		-
		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  “shattering: scattering. what is
		  shattered so often is scattered,
		  strewn all over the place. a history
		  that is down, heavy, is also messy,
		  strewn. the fragments: an assembly.
		  in pieces. becoming army”
		  -Sara Ahmed
