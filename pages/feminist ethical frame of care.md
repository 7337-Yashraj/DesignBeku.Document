### Questions Of the outsider
	- Care - what does it translate into?
		- What does care mean? In the context of producing artefacts, design objects, and socio-technical systems?
		- What role does the notion of care play, does it depend on
			- The "designer" if one were to refer to themselves as such
			- The relations between the members of the collective?
			- The collaborations that take place
			- The process that is followed whilst undertaking an engagement
		- Care: an attribute and behaviour of the human,
			- Is it a action or a manner of existence, or way of interaction, or intent that drives an individual and the collective
			- Is it spoken and takes place through deliberate conversations between the members of the collective, or organizations that approach them
				- Or is it more fluid, organic, and **care**-fully drives from the background
		- Whose definitions and understandings in what contexts, and what examples are followed?
		- Why and how is it [[Feminist]] ethical frame of care.
		- Can care be and is obtrusive? Does it act as a facilitator, or
			- Does it force and coerce?
		- How is that these papers talk about understanding the notion, and practice of care??
	- Ethical:
		- Ethics, and a conversation about ethics?
			- A question of whose ethics
				- Is it a westernized gaze towards the question of ethics
			- Are they bringing in the individual/community/people involved as a part of the conversation?
			- Is this coming on the same page/or is it a mere manner of self course correction and self
	- Frame of care?
		- Can an emotion, and behaviour based practice have a framework?
		- How does it look? Codified and mutually agreed to laws and points to be followed?
		- Or juxtaposing and co-functioning of multiple interpretations, orientations, behaviours?
		- Is it just shifting of frame of reference from heteropatriarchal policies and practices of being to a metaphor?
			- Or is it radically reaffirming, changing your point of view and day to day practices?
	- How does it function in an high-octane environment?
	- What is the point
### Context of use (Where does this function)
	- Central driver of how work is approached
		- How things happen on a day to day basis
		- What happens with how interactions take place?
			- Between members of the collective
			- With the people that they are involved with
			- And whenever and whoever approaches them
