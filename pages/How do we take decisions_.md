## Discussions, Deliberations, Questions, and Answers.
	- ### Whose word is the last word
		- #### **That is exactly not how things would function**
			- "the point of consensus process is to allow a group to decide on a common course of action. Instead of voting proposals up and down, then, proposals are worked and reworked, scotched or reinvented, until one ends up with something everyone can live with. <ins>When it comes to the final stage, actually “finding consensus,” there are two levels of possible objection: one can “stand aside,” which is to say “I don’t like this and won’t participate but I wouldn’t stop anyone else from doing it,” or “block,” which has the effect of a veto. </ins> One can only block if one feels a proposal is in viola- tion of the fundamental principles or reasons for being of a group."

		- #### **Long term goals - are we keeping them in mind?**
			- How ==will things function when they wont be here==
				- Thankfully this doesn't translate into asking, "Where do we see ourselves after 5years?"
		- #### **Does this mean that there needs to be a "test" of sorts every time a new project comes along to decide if DB will take it up or not? Or is that even useful?**
			- Deliberations, discussions are very organic.
			- The nature of relationship that the individuals share with one another, there is ==no need to have a checklist/test/formal way of voting to vet every decision==
		- #### **How do we decide the metrics to see if an experiment has succeeded or failed?**
			- Does this question make sense for the nature of the work that they do?
