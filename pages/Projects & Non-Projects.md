## Interpretations and Understandings
	- How do collaborations take place?
		- Working on a specific research based projects with a certain quantifiable outcomes
		- Situating oneself in the in-betweens, in the non-projects and looking for moments
		- It is to find ways to have lesser control in the way collaborations take shape
	- Not having control over how projects, research directions, outcomes, interactions take place
	- Non-projects situated on the in-betweens help foster fragile relations that help us care for individuals and communities
