  summary:: Views and ideas the participants had about what DB meant to them at the townhall
#### If the bird’s wings were a gift to the civilization, what did the bird get in return?
	- What kind of roles can you occupy in the collective? How do we assign value to this kind of labour?
		- Maintainer-repairer: Can you pick up different projects that are on a slow timeline, catch-up and drive it. Can you see what hasn’t worked for us. Can you support someone who is overburdened.
		- Translator-weaver-facilitator: Can you bring in new contexts, ideas, collaborations, tools and frameworks for us to learn, experiment and work with.
		- Storyteller-archiver-guide: can you archive what kind of things have worked for the collective in the past, remind us of our strengths when there is a lull? Can you tell us stories of the past, present or the future.
		- This is not only a space for designers but for anyone who's interested in community: how to build sustain, and change the world we live in.
		- Could there be a way for people to offer ideas for projects without being "involved" in db
	- Collaborations and strategize initiatives. Tutor newcomers to the collective.
		- How might collectives and collectives come together, co-constitute aspects of each other?
	- Do we need to define a financial structure?
		- Charting finances project-by-project basis.
		- Models that can be explored: Co-operative Crowdfunding Cross-subsidizing Grant-based Chit-fund Grant-based projects Consulting based Teaching, seminars, workshops?
		- Do we need emergency grants for people from the collective, so that we can support them if they need it without conditions?
	- How do we bring transparency? Open protocols of money/work distribution(?)/documentation/legalities
		- When we open conversations with other organizations for funding/projects can we offer a collaborative CSR model
		- Protocols about savings / contingency / support funding (rainy day funds for the collective’s members and other initiatives)
	- Accessibility
		- To speak using words that are familiar and digestible to audience beyond design
		- Creating accessibility by creating permission
