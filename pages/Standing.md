## Discussions, Deliberations, Questions, and Answers.
	- ### What are we standing for?
		- #### **Community and their knowledge spaces.**
			- This is not only a space for designers but <ins>for anyone who's interested in community: how to build sustain, and change the world we live in</ins>
			- The possibility of a better world.
			- By quantifying the value that wellbeing can bring so as to make it a norm
			- ==//: The possibility of informed designers==
			- Inculcated self-awareness
			- Against exisiting ways in which we produce & consume.
			- From the communities as well as from people who've worked with communities. I guess, ==it's important to not rule out any source of learning.==
		- **Create spaces where people can feel the experience** rather than it being oral dissemination of the work.
		- “Handmaidens of history”: speculating on the feminization of archival work https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10502-019-09319-7
		- Solidarity; Kinship
		- Care And Nurture
		- <ins>Self reflexive about our positionality:</ins> ==**debrahminise rather than decolonise**.==
		- #### **Egalitarian principles applied in design practices can challenge number of things.**
			- Rights, Transparencies, ethics in design.
			- Collective learning
			- By ==publishing everything freely & openly, for collaborative engagement.==
			- How are ==we gonna challenge the intellectual hierarchies in the collective?==
			- **Against hegemonic structure** and structural inequality in design (society).
		- #### **A collective that works on individual well being and shared ideals of care for one another and the community.**
			- Collective learning is about ==giving time and space for the members== of the collective to take time, make mistakes, disrupt and change their views & positions
			- How do ==we fight for each other, protect each other given rising fascist controls== and regimes?
			- A trust based relationship is key. How easy or difficult it is?
			- How would DB balance actively <ins>having a cross section of voices</ins>  ( ==with different politics, opinions, values== ) and standing for something as a 'collective'- or is DB a space that is for people with a clear/defined politics.
	- ### What are we standing against?
		- #### **To not become what you set out to demolish**
			- Not become ==gatekeepers of design.==
			- How are we gonna <ins>challenge the intellectual hierarchies in the collective?</ins>
		- #### **Counter-hegemony : what are our values**
			- Justice as a Goal
			- ==Justice as an operating principle==
			- ==Care as a way of moving==
			- Encouraging both <ins>slowness and fastness</ins>
