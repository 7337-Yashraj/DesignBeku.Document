  summary:: Understanding critically what Located Learning in the Peripheries means
### Understanding
	- This part deals with understanding the ==ROLES== that traditionally accepted notions and ideas of a designer warrant
	- Through the experiences narrated by Naveen, wherein the way the collaboratively made templates were repurposed and adopted by the health navigators working on the ground
		- Also, the templates (a tool for documenting daily lifestyles of the patients that the HNs oversaw) were the only part of the solutions outlined that the HNs took ahead, and re-used after the duration of the project
	- It was also interesting to understand that how traditional euro-centric design thinking models that designers follow build and perpetuate a closed, linear, black & white, limited understandings and perceptions of complicated realities
	- The careful disregard that the HNs had about the solutions devised; showcases and reaffirms the fact and identity; of who is the designer
		- Are they the makers of the objects
		- Or the people who repurpose/reconfigure the object into situated contexts that are akin to their communities
	- Essentially questioning the way the role a designer plays in contexts like these
	- Whether we warrant and aid in creation of universal design languages, discourses, & outlooks which present and perpetuate essentially a heteropatriarchal, upper class, upper caste, white reality
		- or we come to terms with the situated-contextual, unique, separate, beautiful repurposing happening on the peripheries and communities
