  summary:: Supporting over Solve
## Interpretation and Understanding
	- ==Support over Solve,== what does it mean????
		- How does it work on the ground?
		- Dynamics of understanding
		- In a world that basks in creating solutions as the first step of action, with an attitude that warrants in being the saviour and liberator for the have-nots, marginalized, and the oppressed
			- It is through supporting, maintaining these fragile networks of care
			- To help and build networks
			- To find and look for issues of the here and now
				- To build kinship, an understanding with an outlook of supporting and caring
		- To care for the mundane and the banal; the regular and the simple
		- A deliberate understanding and careful for the hopes, aspirations, uncertainties, vulnerabilities,
			- And to approach individuals with the sensitization to these values
		- Supporting beyond the confines of realistic and formal guidelines
		- Supporting on the in-betweens of projects and non-projects
