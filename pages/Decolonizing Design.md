  summary:: How do the calls to decolonize design influence and aid in an Indian context
- CATEGORIES
  #TAG1 #TAG2
## Contexts of use
	- The calls for decolonizing design and technology for development drive their intent to reimagine the locations where the act of designing happens
	- Through asking questions like these at different junctures:
		- How does the collective understand the concept of decolonization in an Indian context?
		- How does the positionality of the members of the collective come into the picture?
		- How does a member from a privileged caste and or class navigate spaces, conversations, interactions while working with other members/contributors/collaborative members belonging from the DBA/Oppressed castes and classes
	- How do they navigate the current discourses around "Decolonizing" Design, and the machinery of academia,
	- Understanding Decolonizing Design from the perspective of multiple colonialisms approach, and not using it as a metaphor
	- How can it aid in establishing and practising an ethical feminist frame of care while working with the community
## Questions of the Outsider
	- Decolonization
		- What does "De-colonization" mean in an Indian context?
		- What role does caste play?
	- Do we take into consideration the colonialisms that exist in specific contexts.
	- What does the term De-colonizing bring with it?
	- Is it an action based mechanism
		- Are there practices to bring into action?
		- Or is it about setting the discourse
			- Or bringing it into day-to-day functioning?
	- Are we looking at the multiple interactions that come into play at multiple levels?
## Interpretation and Understanding
	- ### Decolonization is not a metaphor
		- #### The positionality of members
			- The positionality of the member plays a key role in navigating roles, work, interactions while co-existing in a collective and working with members from the oppressed castes and classes
			- The caste locations of the members; as they engage with marginalized communities on the ground should be looked with criticality
			- As a practice which looked towards holding "decolonization" as an important value; as they looked towards
		- #### A case of multiple colonialisms
			- They look towards following an approach set up by Dia Da Costa, termed as "multiple colonialisms"
				- This is an approach which asserts that =="coloniality is not casteless"==
				- It takes into account "intersecting structures of precolonial violence(e.g. caste) and casteist coloniality in one time and space(e.g. so-called postcolonial India) to consider its relational constitution with conventionally recognizable colonialisms(e.g. British colonization of India)"
				- It is about breaking the binary understanding that " all conversations about colonialism, nationalism, and imperialism to Europe and the West."
				- Hence this critical outlook towards understanding Decolonization aids in working in the:
					- Macro contexts of aiming to challenge hegemonized technology, design, development discourse and practices in India
					- Micro contexts of their commitment to working with the marginalized communities at the grassroots
		- #### Decolonizing as an Industry
			- The current discourses and ideologies surrounding Decolonization revolves around
				- Rejecting Design School propaganda rooted in Eurocentric visions of Design and understandings; primarily based on "Ulm model" and "Bauhaus"
				- To build a counter-narrative, and discourse rooted in Indian-ness, and an Indian identity; that stays true to its cultural uniqueness, and strong roots.
			- Can also be referred to as =="Decolonial Colonizers"==
			- This is basically being complicit, and rendering the complicated sub-continental realities and histories into one giant appropriated whole, and erasing generations of trauma
			- As noted by Pandian, this is how =="..hegemonic creative economy discourse relies on a caste supremacy that simultaneously renders creativity and heritage upper caste property, whilst also relentlessly projecting upper castes as casteless."==
		- ### What does Decolonization mean
			- Decolonization is reduced to a metaphor, making a set of evasions that problematically attempt to reconcile settler guilt and complicity.
			- The neoliberal academia has used it as a carrier to appropriate movements under the pretext of social justice to further their ambitions
			- The true aim of decolonization is "repatriation of Indigenous land and life."
			- The current pop-discourse falls short of that, instead using it co-opt different progressive ideals, and a mere metaphor
		- ### Our Assimilations and work
			- asdsad
			- #ReadThisQuote "..respond and be responsible for feminist politics in times of crisis means to stop for a moment, thick critically and create spaces of availability to engage with the problems that affect us as a community, as well as broader ones, acknowledging that some positions can respond more than others."
			- This is about changing vantage points and understanding their own positions to navigate the work and interactions that they do.
