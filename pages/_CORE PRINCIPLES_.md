  summary:: Questioning the concept of core principles and understanding the core principles that guide them on their engagements
## What am I looking for
	- Identifying a certain sets of ideals that one adopts and which drives them ahead is how organizations and collectives function as they exist.
	- How and what are the things that drive DB as a collective? Should there be a comprehensive list of the same?
		- Some things that occurred to me for this:
			- The choices that are made.
			- What do we leave out - it is obvious that we keep away from "Design - Thinking-esque" corporate problem solving mystique, solutionism, broad stroke solutions to "wicked problems"  ``BUT`` What are we leaving out also displays our politics, and whether are we being complicit in establishing structures of oppression through our actions

## Intent and Drive
	- They draw from the [[feminist ethical frame of care]] , which is a ==situated== and
	- #### Signboard - Rabbit hole here (Enter at your own risk!) {This is yet a work in progress, would be edited as time progresses}
		- Core values are aligned with that of - [[Principles of Design Justice Network]]
		- Actions and steps are primarily influenced from - [[feminist ethical frame of care]]
		- If not [[Empathy]] then Who?
		- The intent is motivated by the call for - [[Decolonizing Design]]
		- [[Matrix of Domination]] and other lies that the socialists tell you!! (just kidding.)
		- Understanding [[matters of concern]]
		- Engagements are done following the principles of [[Co-design & Co-production]]
		- [[(Re)Locating]] of design into places where it is intended for use
		- [[Imagining the Imaginations]] - The questions of WHOM
		- [[Technology for development & Matters of Data]]

	- **HENCE**
	  Work stems from the shared ideals, formulated lived experience from "... <ins>co-design</ins> becomes for us a  **care-in-practice,** an **onto-epistemology** enabling us ^^to align with the local matters of concerns^^ to ``collaboratively evolve systemic solutions, enabled by, but not led by technology.``" (quoting from:DB Fundamental Doc)
## The Principles That Drive Practice
	- [[Infrastructuring for community care]] - Understanding through the work of Naveen what it means to relocate and situate care
	- [[Located Learning in the Peripheries]] - Repurposing understandings
	- [[Assumptions & Subjective Standards]] an heroic tale
	- [[Evolving Place based network of care]] - A situated practice based on fragile relationships of trust and care.
	- [[Projects & Non-Projects]] - Non-project mode and In-betweenness in situating ‘Care’
	- [[Co-learning and learning from below]]
	- [[Support over Solve]]
## Rooted in Reality.
	- Identify how these work along with each other in-order to understand does and how the whole is greater than the sum of all parts.
