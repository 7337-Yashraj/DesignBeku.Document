  summary:: Questioning the concept of core principles and understanding the core principles that guide them on their engagements
### Literature Notes
	- Identifying a certain sets of ideals that one adopts and which drives them ahead is how organizations and collectives function as they exist.
	- How and what are the things that drive DB as a collective? Should there be a comprehensive list of the same?
		- Some things that occurred to me for this:
			- The choices we make.
			- What do we leave out - it is obvious that we keep away from "Design - Thinking-esque" corporate problem solving mystique, solutionism, broad stroke solutions to "wicked problems"  ``BUT`` What are we leaving out also displays our politics, and whether are we being complicit in establishing structures of oppression through our actions
			-
			  see:: [[Solutionism and Problem Solving]]
	- Core values are aligned with that of - [[Principles of Design Justice Network]]
	- Actions and steps are primarily influenced from - [[feminist ethical frame of care]]
	- Engagements are done on the principles of [[Co-design & Co-production]]
	- The intent is motivated by the call for - [[Decolonizing Design]] && [[Technology for development]]
	- Work for them is an expression of how "... <ins>co-design</ins> becomes for us a  **care-in-practice,** an **onto-epistemology** enabling us ^^to align with the local matters of concerns^^ to ``collaboratively evolve systemic solutions, enabled by, but not led by technology.``"
	- The belief that this socio-political-corporate patriarchal machinery can be countered with practices and beliefs that are driven by feminist ethical frame of reference, is ever-present and influences every step and action.
	- Identify how these work along with each other in-order to understand does and how the whole is greater than the sum of all parts.
