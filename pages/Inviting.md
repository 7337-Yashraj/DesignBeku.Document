			- if a practitioner is brings in a project in a sector or with methodologies that DB has traditionally not used, then ==how does DB encourage them or support them and not leave them to their own devices) - ways of dealing with newness.==
				- <ins>Engagements happen out of mutual respect for the collaborators first,</ins>  their views and opinions
				- They are ==given a space== to talk and give their opinions
			- How do we make it <ins> less about their difference of practice and rather more about our learning?</ins>
				- Learning being a constant process, that stems from the way projects are not looked as a set of strict guidelines and deadlines that need to be achieved, but an exercise to learn and grow
			- How can people from different practices be supported and encouraged to work with us in this project?
