## Questions
	- #### What shapes do we take when we grow? How do we grow? How do we nurture ourselves?
		- //: Scale/ proportion of individuals wrt intersectional ideals/ values/ identities ?
			- Redefining Scaling = Forming kinships with other collectives, bridging and building solidarities.
			- Scale could be measured by the impact of activities
			- Scale as growth (individuals + collective + context)
			- Scale can be measured by the number of non-design disciplines the collective collaborated with.
			- Scale is as it is imagined by the collective. Can be varied.
			- We should be more like good bacteria, that grows, changes but all for the greater good. Microbiome of the gut :-)
			- Do you mean scale as in 'more of the same', or scale as 'less of a better version'?
			- A project in relation to our existing capacity and capabilities
		- Create a database of people willing to offer their strengths to projects and work with them as projects grow
			- How do we address the challenge of newcomers vs experienced practitioners?
			- How might we harness people to define their own growth?
			- Design Beku itself grows and this is the challenge, it would be sort of decentralized ways of 'choosing' projects.
		- Scale itself is a problematic word. Maybe we think about it as flows?
			- Scale is only problematic if you think of it as a linear system. If you imagine instead a way to scale the principles instead of the practice, I feel like the foundations can be laid in more sold grounds.
			- Scale is the notion of force-fitting or imposing something, which is pre-determined and highly problematic.
			- Scale can sometimes translate to coercion
