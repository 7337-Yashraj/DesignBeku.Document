## Discussions, Deliberations, Questions, and Answers.
	- ### What shapes do we take when we grow? How do we grow? How do we nurture ourselves?
		- #### **//: Scale/ proportion of individuals wrt intersectional ideals/values/ identities?**
			- Redefining Scaling  ==Forming kinships== with other collectives, bridging and building solidarities.
			- Scale could be measured by the impact of activities
			- Scale as ==growth== (individuals + collective + context)
			- Scale can be measured by the number of non-design disciplines the collective collaborated with.
			- Scale is as it is imagined by the collective. Can be varied.
			- <ins> We should be more like good bacteria,</ins> that grows, changes but all for the greater good. Microbiome of the gut :-)
			- Do you mean scale as in 'more of the same', or scale as 'less of a better version'?
			- _A project in relation to our **existing** capacity and capabilities_
		- #### **Create a database of people willing to offer their strengths to projects and work with them as projects grow**
			- How do we address the challenge of ==newcomers vs experienced practitioners?==
			- How might we harness people to <ins>define their own growth?</ins>
			- Design Beku itself grows and this is the challenge, it would be sort of decentralized ways of 'choosing' projects.
		- ### **Scale itself is a problematic word. Maybe we think about it as flows?**
			- Scale is only problematic if you think of it as a linear system. ==If you imagine instead a way to scale the principles instead of the practice== I feel like the foundations can be laid in more sold grounds.
			- Scale is the notion of force-fitting or imposing something, which is pre-determined and highly problematic.
			- Scale can sometimes <ins>translate to coercion</ins>
