## Contexts of use
	- The day to day functioning driven by a feminist ethical frame of care vs how empathy as a faux ethics
	- Prescriptive vs Descriptive manner of functioning
## Questions of the Outsider
	- Empathy as a superficial, performative, farcical, corporatized manner of setting up a discourse that appropriates and co-opts liberal and political ideas
	- How this is a manner of oppression
	- How this is hijacked by the discourse; and the same shady corporates
		- It is good to name and call out the practices that they perpetuate
	- Why the feminist ethical frame of care is a way to counter the heteropatriarchal empathetic "Design Interventions"
## Interpretation and Understanding
	- ### Empathy as a replacement of Ethics of care
		- Working without much context, empathy is often fashioned as the one silver bullet; that should be a tool in the arsenal of designers to bring about "disruptive" design solutions to "wicked" problems
		- Often equated and rooted into pervasive practices like:
			- Empathy mapping
			- Getting into the shoes of the users
	- ### Empathy as the buzzword
		- It is looked as a step in the process, which needs to be checked-off
## Literature Review
	- ### Empathizing in design practice
		- The initial phase in the design process; used by designers to get an understanding about the users
		- The manner in which "empathy" is practised works in a counterproductive manner
	- ### Empathy as a Faux ethics
		- #### Empathy Reinforcing Otherness
		- #### Empathy ignoring ecology
		- #### Beyond Empathy
