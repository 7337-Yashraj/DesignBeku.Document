  summary:: Understanding critically how does Infrastucturing for community care
### Understanding (Naveen's experience with working @ MAYA)
	- Naveen talks about why usually solutions that were helicoptered in from Silicon Valley places don't function on the ground
		- An important thing to keep in mind how imaginations are imagined elsewhere
		- And why that malfunctions, creating more problems than it solves
	- The "manifesto" that has been created talks about
		- Infrastructuring is about shifting positions and perspectives
		- The realities and sensitization that is needed to work in the fields of providing healthcare services to "underserved" communities
			- The role that care plays in these situations, relationships and how it is navigated
			- It is an exercise into taking deliberate and intentional caring efforts
		- Design ==CANNOT== DEVELOP DISRUPTIVE SOLUTIONS.
			- The way design is understood and explained is as: "...design is a mode of highly situated and collaborative inquiry to both understand, and to artfully integrate digital technology as part of local, ongoing practices of good care "
		- It is important to take a note of extractive data policies, and politics that come into the picture, and individuals are looked to as data points in this pool of "big data."
		- Their efforts are into creating
		- #### Doing away with solutionism
		  id:: 6107d314-3432-4449-aefd-cca8cc292a6f
			- Away with one silver bullet which can solve everything; often a propagation of techbros,
			- Understanding the realities of community-based healthcare, and what are the realities of multiple colonialisms coming into the picture
			- Discarding discoverability and the idea that there is some magical mystical solution that can solve it all
		- #### Perspective that foregrounds relocation, situated practise
			- That enables the individuals from the community to build socio-technical resources and infrastructure
			- To build solutions for their own issues and implement them
		- #### Democratize Design
			- Of Digital tools for health and wellbeing locate it as a part of communities and their living
			- And of health data - so that the communities can engage and make meaning out of their own data
