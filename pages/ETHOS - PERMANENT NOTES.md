- ### Solutionism & Problem Solving
	- It is necessary to know and critically understand the perspectives and gaze that are followed towards resolving conflicts that are inherently very complicated and intersectional in their nature.
	- Coming to a critical understanding of how it is that these established systems present and perpetuate solutionism, instead of understanding the nature and core of how these situations arrive.
	- Working on the level of "experience": Moving from a **current** certain state towards a **desired**  state.
	- Technocratic, Patriarchal, Corporate, Capitalist, Casteist perspective from above, functions towards establishing dominance, and extracting the individuality, humanity, soul, and character of humans.
- ### To COUNTER or To DEVELOP
	- The pattern of [co-designing] developing systemic solutions (collaboratively) led by technology
		- Serves as an answer that answers the question of what is the role that they view themselves playing in the change making process.
	- The character behind this attitude is from the idea to counter (challenge) by developing (nurturing) communities, and contexts to build a resistance to the patriarchal machinery.
	- The idea to explore how design can be decolonial, local and ethical working with contexts, collaborators, and not clients.
- Just by listening, and being, existing one learns so much more
- Necessity of contexts and how situations and experiences drive the way ahead, namely,
	- Steps that will be taken
	- Their own attitudes
	- The expectations that they will keep from their work, process, outcomes
- The necessity of constantly asking questions to self, and introspect about the way the process and progress is happening.
	- An outcome is only as transparent and ethical as its process.
	- Ironically, quoting Steve Jobs, The Journey is the Reward.
