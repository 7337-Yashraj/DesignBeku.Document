  summary:: What does Problem Solving mean for people whom we are designing for
### Previously The Approaches that I had
	- To create impactful grassroots change that can solve the wicked problems faced by the marginalized and can be scaled onto different laterals. This is the buzzword of our times.
		- We looked towards "engaging" with the "stakeholders" making sure that the designs we build are "human-centered"
		- Creating "humanized" interactions that "enable" the "users" to have a more "engaging, efficient, ecstatic" EXPERIENCE.
		- Looking towards saving the marginalized.
		- Broad brushstroke like solution, that was driven by the desire to ^^SOLVE.^^
	- Treatment of subjects like objects that are marginalized due to conditions befallen on them.
	- Single thing that can bring about change.
	- #### Decolonialize Design
		- Influenced by the theory of [[Decolonizng Design]] propagated by Ahmed Ansari, and others.
		- Questions that I had
			- What does Decolonizing mean in the Indian Subcontinental context?
			- What role does caste play in this?
	- #### Digital Interfaces for illiterate users
		- EdTech Hubs principles
		- What does the interface mean?
		- The idea of it being the first step of interaction between the systems of the state and the individual
- Oppression vs Marginalization
- Solutionism how it exists --
	- Design thinking with it's shrouds of majestic identity
