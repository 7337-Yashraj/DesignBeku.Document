	- To create impactful grassroots change that can solve the wicked problems faced by the marginalized and can be scaled onto different laterals. This is the buzzword of our times.
		- We looked towards "engaging" with the "stakeholders" making sure that the designs we build are "human-centered"
		- Creating "humanized" interactions that "enable" the "users" to have a more "engaging, efficient, ecstatic" EXPERIENCE.
		- Looking towards saving the marginalized.
		- Broad brushstroke like solution, that was driven by the desire to ^^SOLVE.^^
