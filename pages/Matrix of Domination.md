## Contexts of use
	- A framework to understand, identify how inequality, and oppression is perpetuated

## Questions of the Outsider
	- What is the "matrix of domination"?
		- Critically understanding what it is
		- What are the lenses and outlooks that is adopted
		- Whose voices are centered?
		- Is centering of voices the steps towards ensuring justice
## Interpretation and Understanding
	- ### Dismantling Matrix of Domination
		- The work that Design Beku advocates can be divided into two parts:
			- Responsible and ethical use of Design and Technology across diverse use cases, scenarios, and contexts
			- The contexts include
				- Local: A sight of slow, situated, place based care
				- Online(Global): A sight of intersections of powers and operations, personal, state, national, international
		- It is here where the drive is to dismantle the matrix of domination
			- It is to take the aid of the framework to identify, question, and fight against the methods which perpetuate inequality
		- Matrix of domination has its roots in the work of Black Feminist scholar, sociologist, Patricia Hill Collins.
## Literature Review
	- ### Intersectionality and Matrix of Domination
		- This term for her is  ".. a mode of analysis that includes any and all systems of oppression that mutually constitute each other and shape people's lives."
	- ### Race, Class, and Gender
	- This intersectional feminist analysis helps us build a comprehensive understanding of ourselves
		- That we are parts of multiple dominant groups and subordinate groups deriving multiple and varied levels of oppression and penalty from our positionality
	- ### Sites of Domination where it functions
		- #### The level of personal biography
		- #### The group or community level of the cultural context created by race, class and gender
		- #### The systemic level of social institutions
	- It is necessary to understand the ways and how's of the work that is done functions at these levels:
		- PERSONAL
		- COMMUNITY
		- INSTITIUTIONAL
	- ### Value of Situated Knowledge vs Universalist Knowledge
		- Nature of power, and oppression should be understood from the perspective of the oppressed
		-
		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  “The  overarching  matrix  of  domination houses multiple groups, each with varying experiences with penalty  and  privilege  that  produce  corresponding  partial  perspectives,  situated  knowledges,  and,  for  clearly  identifiable  subordinate  groups,  subjugated knowledges. No one group has a clear angle of vision. No one group possesses the theory or methodology that allows it to discover the absolute ‘truth’ or, worse yet, proclaim its theories and methodologies as the universal norm evaluating other groups’ experiences.”
		  #+END_QUOTE
	- The idea is to fight our way out of this through the methods, means of design justice network and feminist ethical frame of cares.
	- Working with the communities and grounds.
