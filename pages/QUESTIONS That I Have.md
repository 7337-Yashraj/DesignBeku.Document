  summary:: A set of questions that I had in-between and during the process of going through the different references; a collection of driving questions that influenced how I treated the given material
- Why **Design**
	- What are the uses and ways that design contribute towards looking into problems that are inherently very socio-political-behavioural in nature?
		- I mean what are the ways and manner can a field produce real change.
		- What is my gaze when I'm looking towards this so called CHANGE? ^^Saviour Complex Much?^^
			- And where is it that they are operating?
			- Does that choice show an inherent politics at play?
	- When they say that they are trying to design with and not for, what are the ideals/aim that they look towards? Is there a particular idea that **THEY** wish to see manifest.
	- Is there an inherent bias, a gaze
	- ``Involving the other`` | ``Working With the Other``
	- Relationship between people. Going from objects to individuals.
		- Are we reducing the identity to just that?
		- Engaging with the communities
	- What are our thoughts, beliefs, and ideals that come into play?
- Are we or are we not exoticizing ?
	- How do the conversations with the community take place?
		- How do we make sure of the way people are sensitised towards the issues that we are getting into.
	- Scaling outwards?
- Feminist notions of care: **Our Sources** - Savarna Gaze
	- Who is it that we are listening to?
	- Is there an inherent politics in that which we need to keep on questioning and looking for answers to?
### Inherent Nature of our Engagements?
	- Things to remain in the domain of developing ideas on how life works across action- and steps that humans take.
		- What do people do, and how do they do it differently
		- How is there a notion of bewilderment and beauty in the way individuals that are marginalized navigate their lives and issues that they face
			- This also includes the interaction with systems, objects and individuals
	- Whereas I want to work on the domain of things, suffering happening onto, and steps henceforth.
		- Does this also from a desire to control and drive
			- IS this the ^^CENTRAL IDEA??^^ - The drive to be in the drivers seat.
				- Whereas whatever we do, the identity should be a product of the lived experience of the marginalized individual
				- The state as the giver of rights | The beurocracy as the enforcer
					- Does individual hopes, aspirations, identities, ideas, being and habits come into the picture? when it comes to participating with, taking a part, or is it
						- Pre-conceived, pre-made, and thought after
					- Is this the question that needs to be asked?
- Knowing that it is through the help of one-other, and each other we can go ahead as people
- Kinship of care in our own interpersonal connections - the underlying core principle behind it all
- Who the digital citizen is
	- The idea of self-importance | world is bigger than us.. What they do is bigger than us
- [[APPROACH]]
