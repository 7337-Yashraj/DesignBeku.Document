### Literature Notes
	- #### Principles of Design Justice Network
		- The point of this story is to provide a small but concrete example from my own daily lived experience of how larger systems—including norms, values, and assumptions—are encoded in and reproduced through the design of sociotechnical systems, or in political theorist Langdon Winner’s famous words, how “artifacts have politics.
		- cis-normativity is enforced at multiple levels of a traveler’s interaction with airport security systems.
		- The goal of the workshop was to move beyond the frames of social impact design or design for good, to challenge designers to think about how good intentions are not necessarily enough to ensure that design processes and practices become tools for liberation, and ==to develop principles that might help design practitioners avoid the (often unwitting) reproduction of existing inequalities.==
		- As Browne discusses, and as Joy Buolamwini, founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, technically demonstrates, gender itself is racialized
		- Reasoning through design is a mode of knowledge production that is neither primarily deductive nor inductive, but rather abductive and speculative.
