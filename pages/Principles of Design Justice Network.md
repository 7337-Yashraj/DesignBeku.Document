  summary:: Notes about the Principles of Design Justice Network
### Literature Notes
	- #### Principles of Design Justice Network
		- ### The requirement for principles
		- These principles are a set an intersectional feminist framework for design theory and practice.
		-
		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  The point of this story is to provide a small but concrete example from my own daily lived experience of how ``larger systems—including norms, values, and assumptions—are encoded in and reproduced through the design of sociotechnical systems,`` or in political theorist Langdon Winner’s famous words, how “==artifacts have politics==
		  #+END_QUOTE .
			- Most of the design practices today <ins>reproduce inequalities</ins> through, what the black feminists call the [["Matrix of Domination"]]
		- **Cis-normativity** is enforced at multiple levels of a traveler’s interaction with airport security systems.
		- The goal of the workshop was to move beyond the frames of social impact design or design for good, to challenge designers to think about how good intentions are not necessarily enough to ensure that design processes and practices become tools for liberation, and ==to develop principles that might help design practitioners avoid the (often unwitting) reproduction of existing inequalities.==
		- As Browne discusses, and as Joy Buolamwini, founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, technically demonstrates, gender itself is racialized.
			- Reasoning through design is a mode of knowledge production that is neither primarily deductive nor inductive, but rather abductive and speculative.
		- Design justice is a field of theory and practice that is concerned with how the design of objects and systems influences the distribution of risks, harms, and benefits among  various  groups  of  people.
## What Does Justice Mean?
	- Am I looking at definitions to understand or to understand how does it happen in practice?
		- In the paper. "Escape from Domination" the author talks about how the Principles came into being and what was done to formulate these principles.
			- Can principles of justice be a mutually shared ideals agreed upon to by the participants at the AMC in the summer of 2015.
			- Has its roots in Allied Media Projects(AMP) network principles; the Detroit Digital Justice Coalition(DDJC) digital justice principles, and the pedagogy of the Detroit Future Youth.
			- It moves away from the frameworks and ideas proposed by ==SOCIAL IMPACT DESIGN / DESIGN FOR GOOD==
			- That the outlook changes from looking towards the intentions, outcomes of the designer, the design process, and the creation
			- To move beyond the traditional formulated understandings of the role and the so-called "change" that designers can bring.
			- **Making sure that Design does

	- ^^PRINCIPLE 1^^
		-
		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  "We use design to sustain, heal, and empower our communities, as well as to seek liberation from exploitative and oppressive systems."
		  #+END_QUOTE
		- It is to identify both internalized and external forms of oppression - with a focus towards how actions, tools, and practices can be developed to sustain, heal and empower our communities
		- To seek liberation: What does one referred to as being "liberated" and in what aspects
		- In dealing with communities how do we deal with realities of caste and gender?
		-
	- ^^PRINCIPLE 2^^
		-
		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  We center the voices of those who are directly impacted by the outcomes of the design process.
		  #+END_QUOTE
		- "Whom do we listen to?" A direct and deliberate effort to center the voices - to "pass on the mic"
		- What does it mean to <ins>center the voices</ins>
		- What should drive us in all our steps - the CENTER the voices.
	- ^^PRINCIPLE 3^^
		-
		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  We prioritize design’s impact on the community over the intentions of the designer.
		  #+END_QUOTE
		- Separation between individual's creation and the effect that it will have.
		- Looking towards what is the impact that it will create
			- Asking difficult questions from the begining
			- Not looking for the silver bullet answer that can solve every problem
		- Not looking for the magical pill
		- Appreciating critical considerations and practical restrictions
		- The most important part, as I think this is where the real world politics, human emotions, egos, and the group dynamics come into the picture
		- How is it that there is a line of sight maintained whenever things get foggy
		- Who is the one: Guarder of the collective conscience
		- Is it the people that we are involved with, who are collaborating with us
		- How do we also make sure that, the most oppressed, the faintest of the faintest voices have the voice on the discussion table?
	- ^^PRINCIPLE 4^^
		-
		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  We view change as emergent from an accountable, accessible, and collaborative process, rather than as a point at the end of a process.
		  #+END_QUOTE
		- Involving the stakeholders at every position, and change in the decision making process
			- Striving towards a collective change entails that at every juncture, everyone should be a made a part
			- Transparency and collaborative is assured when attitudes of the individuals taking a part are made sure to be open, understanding, fair, collaborative, creative
		- Collective conscience keeper,ow do different toles make sure
		- Understanding what change and care means for them
			- From the beginning, and at every step
		- Means are as important as end.
	- ^^PRINCIPLE 5^^
		-
		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  We see the role of the designer as a facilitator rather than an expert.
		  #+END_QUOTE
		- The way Shreyas talks about how the idea of an expert is given to an identity that has had layers of privilege: should not be confused with "expertise"
		- Opinions, anecdotes, stories, experiences, and lived experience over theoretical, professional, expert constructs of understanding issues and problems of the community
	- ^^PRINCIPLE 6^^
		-
		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  We believe that everyone is an expert based on their own lived experience, and that we all have unique and brilliant contributions to bring to a design process.
		  #+END_QUOTE
		- Lived Experience is a valid form of documented experience
		- Getting away from the hegemonized, academic, theoretically
	- ^^PRINCIPLE 7^^
		-
		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  We share design knowledge and tools with our communities.
		  #+END_QUOTE
	- ^^PRINCIPLE 8^^
		-
		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  We work towards sustainable, community-led and -controlled outcomes.
		  #+END_QUOTE
	- ^^PRINCIPLE 9^^
		-
		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  We work towards non-exploitative solutions that reconnect us to the earth and to each other.
		  #+END_QUOTE
	- ^^PRINCIPLE 10^^
		-
		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  Before seeking new design solutions, we look for what is already working at the community level. We honor and uplift traditional, indigenous, and local knowledge and practices.
		  #+END_QUOTE
- #ReadThisQuote Feminist standpoint theory recognizes that all knowledge is situated in the particular embodied experiences of the knower.
### Participatory Action Research (PAR)
	- Roots in the works of authors like
		- Kurt Lewin

		- Paulo Freire
		- Orlando Fals-Borda
		- Linda Tuhiwai Smith
		-
		  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  "...it emphasizes the development of communities of shared inquiry and action."
		  #+END_QUOTE
	- Both PAR and codesign consider communities to be co-researchers and co-designers, rather than solely research subjects or test-users
	- HENCE
		- **Working with and not for.**
- Remaking, Re-imagining, Rethinking through our own gazes and visions
### Key Terms
	- #### Design
		- Design for the Real World, Victor Papanek positions design  as  a  universal  practice  in  human  communities:  “All  [people] are  designers...Design  is  the  conscious  effort  to  impose  a  meaningful  order.”
		- Anne- Marie Willis, professor of design theory and editor of Design Philosophy Papers, puts it this way,
			-
			  collapsed:: true
			  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
			  Design  is  something  far  more  pervasive  and  profound  than  is  generally  recognized  by  designers,  cultural  theorists,  philosophers  or  lay  persons;  ==designing  is  fundamental to being human— we design, that is to say, we deliberate, plan and scheme in ways which prefigure our actions and makings .==.. ``we design our world``, **while our world acts back on us and designs us**
			  #+END_QUOTE
			- Not as an expert activity that comes with an individual who has expertise
				- But individuals
				- But way of being and existing
				- Design practices are often, the reconfigurations, reimaginations labour that are visualized and made in the unrecognized, vernacular, invisibilized settings far away from the annals of corporatized, expertized, hegemonic ivory towers
		- This is understanding of complex, and hidden
